# HalfBuilt

The inspiration behind building HalfBuilt cab be found in this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/madhavkauntia_madhav-kauntia-activity-6886899740643086336-Nh4Y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

This platform could be used to find projects on certain tech stacks which could help developers build real-world projects having learnt theoretical concepts.

The frontend of this project was built but the backend was not.

Ironically, this project remains _half built_.
